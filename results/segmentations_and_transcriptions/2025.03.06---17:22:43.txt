speaker_1 [1.81-4.13]: Hello, Amy. I'm Dr. Jones. How are you doing today?
speaker_0 [6.19-8.97]: I'm okay, but it hurts when I go to the bathroom when I pee.
speaker_1 [10.37-13.79]: That's called dysuria and it's pretty common. When did this start?
speaker_0 [14.59-18.07]: Two days ago. Have you taken anything for it?
speaker_0 [18.65-21.87]: I tried some Tylenol and drank cranberry juice. It helped.

speaker_1 [83.40-85.56]: Do you have any other problems that you'd like me to address?
speaker_0 [86.14-86.70]: No.
speaker_1 [88.43-92.49]: I would like to do a simple physical exam and have you give us a urine sample.
speaker_1 [93.29-98.69]: I will order both a pregnancy test and a urine test and that we will do now and determine
speaker_1 [98.69-100.55]: treatment when we have the results.
speaker_1 [100.75-101.81]: Does that sound okay to you?
