speaker_1 [0.00-0.86]:  yeah  good
speaker_0 [0.86-6.42]:  morning  mr  harris  uh  before  we  get  started  can  i  confirm  your  birthday  uh
speaker_1 [6.42-12.06]:  yeah  sure  um  so  my  birthday  is  november  3rd  1987  great
speaker_0 [12.06-15.08]:  great  so  um  how  can  i  help  you  today  yeah
speaker_1 [15.08-27.92]:  look  um  basically  i'm  just  uh  experiencing  severe  pain  in  my  kind  of  like  lower  back  and  also  abdomen  um  it's  been  happening  for  the  last  couple  of  days  and  uh
speaker_1 [29.04-33.64]:  Kind  of  comes  and  goes,  but  when  it's  there,  it's  really,  really  bad  and  painful.
speaker_1 [34.80-42.18]:  I'm  also  feeling  nauseous  and  I  guess  most  scarily  of  all,  I  noticed  some  blood  in  my  urine.
speaker_1 [43.22-45.06]:  Yeah,  I'm  kind  of  worried  about  that.
speaker_0 [45.42-59.74]:  Yeah,  that's  definitely  concerning.  So  let  me  ask  you  a  few  questions.  Have  you  experienced  any  urinary  changes  such  as...  uh  you  know  frequency  or  urgency  or  any  kind  of  difficulty  passing  urine
speaker_1 [59.74-73.38]:  um  no  not  not  really  i  mean  i've  noticed  that  my  urine  has  the  output  output  has  slightly  decreased  but  yeah  no  difficulty  or  pain  nothing
speaker_0 [73.38-80.18]:  okay  um  have  you  ever  ex  uh  had  a  similar  episode  in  the  past
speaker_1 [81.77-86.09]:  Oh,  no,  no.  This  is  the  first  time  I  would  have  remembered  if  I  had  something  like  this  before.
speaker_0 [86.47-87.71]:  Oh,  I  see.
speaker_0 [89.29-97.31]:  Has  there  been  any  recent  trauma  or  injury  to  your  back  or  abdomen  or  anything  in  your  midsection?
speaker_1 [98.05-105.09]:  No,  not  really,  doctor.  I  haven't  had  any  recent  injuries.
speaker_1 [106.09-108.53]:  The  pain  kind  of  just  appeared  out  of  nowhere.
speaker_0 [108.93-110.43]:  I  see.  Okay.
speaker_0 [111.26-116.12]:  So  I  think  we  should  run  some  tests,  but  based  on  your  symptoms,
speaker_0 [117.92-139.64]:  I  think  you  might  have  kidney  stones.  I  think  we  might  be  that  might  be  the  thing  we're  dealing  with,  you  know,  especially  the  back  pain,  the,  the,  the,  especially  the  presence  of  blood  in  the  urine  is  indicative  of  this  typical  of  this  condition,  but  let,  let's  confirm  with  some  tests.  But  I  think  that  that's  where  I  think  that's  what  we're  looking  at.
speaker_1 [140.00-149.82]:  Okay.  Okay.  Uh,  kidney  stones,  huh?  I've,  um,  yeah,  I  mean,  I've  heard  of  them.  Um,  um,  some  of  my  family  members  had  them,  had  them,  never  thought  I  would  have  them.
speaker_1 [150.62-154.52]:  Um,  but  yeah.  Um,  what,  what  tests  should  we  do?
speaker_0 [155.48-166.56]:  So  first  we'll  need  to  analyze  your  urine  for  signs  of  infection  or  stones  that  we  can  do  today  should  be,  you  know,  once  we  finish  up,  the  nurse  will  come  in,
speaker_0 [169.40-171.12]:  should  be  relatively  quick.
speaker_0 [171.96-187.70]:  The  other  thing  that  I  want  to  run  is  a  blood  test.  I  just  want  to  confirm  that  there's  nothing  going  wrong  with  your  kidney  function,  just  to  make  sure  everything's  kind  of,  you  know,  your  blood  is  still  being  filtered  and  cleaned.  Your  kidneys  are  still  performing,  basically.
speaker_0 [188.88-193.08]:  The  thing  we'll  do,  again,  that  blood  test,  the  nurse  will  come  in  later,
speaker_0 [195.70-203.00]:  before  you  leave  today.  So  after  we  run  those  tests,  it  should  be  about  a  day,  maybe  two  days  to  before  we  get  an  answer.
speaker_0 [203.98-216.12]:  But  you  know,  we'll  get  an  answer  we  can  plan  on  after  that.  What  I'll  also  do  is  I'm  going  to  I'm  going  to  schedule  you  a  follow  up  for  a  renal  ultrasound.  What  this  will
speaker_0 [218.91-234.95]:  you  know  they'll  visualize  your  your  kidneys  and  if  there  are  any  large  stones  we'll  get  a  clear  picture  on  how  many  how  big  they  are  that  sort  of  thing  uh  so  nothing  you  know  just  some  initial  tests  nothing  invasive  okay
speaker_1 [234.95-249.09]:  okay  yeah  um  i  mean  i'm  i'm  happy  that  we'll  be  able  to  figure  out  what's  happening  really  want  to  get  rid  of  this  pain  um  what  should  i  expect  in  terms  of  treatment  if  we  confirm  that  these  are  kidney  stones
speaker_0 [249.09-282.58]:  so  kidney  stones  are  very  treatable  very  typical  problem  it  happens  in  a  large  segment  of  the  population  so  it's  nothing  to  be  afraid  of  in  terms  of  terms  of  trees  of  treatment  a  lot  of  times  it's  as  simple  as  you  know  increasing  your  hydration  you  know  being  very  dedicated  in  uh  increasing  your  hydration  like  i  want  you  know  ideally  you'll  be  drinking  like  at  least  almost  half  a  gallon  of  water  a  day,  maybe  more.  And  we  can,  we  can  kind  of,  I'll  do  the,  you  know,  we'll  have  a  bit  of  a  look  on  exactly  how  much  you  should  be  taking,  but  really  over -hydrating
speaker_0 [284.80-294.50]:  some  pain  management.  So  we'll,  you  know,  if  we  confirm  the  diagnosis,  typically,  you  know,  we'll  give  you  a  prescription  for  some  pain  management  drugs.
speaker_0 [295.60-296.34]:  And  then
speaker_0 [297.73-321.09]:  ideally  you  just  pass  the  stones  naturally  as  part  of  that  process.  Um,  they'll,  Oh,  sorry.  There's  also  some  medications  around  just  making  it  easier  to  pass  the  stones  in  your  urine.  So  some  medications  that'll  help  break  down  the  stones  in  your  kidneys  and  just,  you  know,  hopefully  they're  small  and  they  just,  they  just  pass  through.  Um,  so  a  lot  of  the  times  it's  just
speaker_0 [322.12-365.82]:  In  some  cases,  I  would  say,  uh,  you  know,  a  good  chunk  of  cases,  uh,  if  the  stones  are  a  little  too  large  or  if  they're  causing  some  complications,  we,  one  of  the  things  we'll  do  is,  uh,  we'll  probably  do  is  a  shockwave  lithotripsy.  Okay.  That's  where  you're  suspended  in  a,  in  a,  in  a  water,  effectively  a  liquid  bath.  And  essentially  ultrasonic  waves  are  shot  at  your,  at  the  stones  in  your  kidneys  with  the  goal  of  essentially  breaking  them  up  and  making  them  smaller  so  that  you  can  pass  them  normally.  In  very  rare  circumstances,  we  may  also  have  to  schedule  a  surgery,  but  I  don't,  I  don't,  that's  not  a  typical.
speaker_0 [367.33-384.47]:  case  but  you  know  we'll  have  to  see  based  on  the  results  of  the  test  but  i  wouldn't  worry  too  much  about  it  it's  pretty  standard  there's  not  that  you  know  that's  uh  it's  a  very  well  understood  uh  both  a  well  understood  disease  and  also  well  understood  process  so  it's  nothing  life  threatening  nothing  to  worry  about
speaker_1 [384.47-393.61]:  okay  thank  you  thanks  for  clarifying  that  yeah  let's  definitely  hope  it's  not  going  to  be  any  surgical  but  uh  yeah  i  really  really  appreciate  the  explanation
speaker_1 [396.38-399.88]:  I  think  let's,  let's  move  forward  with  this  then.
speaker_0 [400.50-416.04]:  Okay.  So  I'll,  I'll  call  in  the  nurse.  She'll  finish  up  the,  you  know,  I'll  finish  up  a  little  bit  of  my  write -up,  call  the  nurse.  She'll  take  your  tests.  We  should  know,  we  should  have,  should  have  pretty  good  confirmation  within  24  hours,  24  to  48  hours.  Once  the  lab  results  come  back.
speaker_0 [416.90-422.68]:  And  then  we  can  schedule  you  for  the  follow -up  stuff  there.  And  if  you  go  to  the  front,  go  to  the  front  desk,  they'll  schedule  you  for  the  ultrasound.
speaker_1 [423.43-429.55]:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Great.  Thank  you  so  much,  doctor.  And,  uh,  yeah,  have  a  good  day.  Thank  you.
speaker_0 [430.57-432.41]:  Uh,  have  a  good  day.  Bye.
