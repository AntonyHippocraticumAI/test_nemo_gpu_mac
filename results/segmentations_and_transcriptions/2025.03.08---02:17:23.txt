speaker_0 [1.81-4.13]:  Hello,  Amy.  I'm  Dr.  Jones.  How  are  you  doing  today?
speaker_1 [6.19-8.97]:  I'm  okay,  but  it  hurts  when  I  go  to  the  bathroom  when  I  pee.
speaker_1 [10.37-11.69]:  That's  called  dysuria  and
speaker_0 [11.69-13.79]:  it's  pretty  common.  When  did  this  start?
speaker_1 [14.59-15.53]:  Two  days  ago.
speaker_1 [16.61-21.87]:  Have  you  taken  anything  for  it?  I  tried  some  Tylenol  and  drank  cranberry  juice.  It  helped.
speaker_1 [23.07-24.17]:  Have  you  had  this  before?
speaker_1 [25.13-28.71]:  Yes,  I  had  this  several  years  ago  before  you  were  my  doctor.
speaker_1 [29.80-31.50]:  Do  you  remember  about  what  year  that  was?
speaker_1 [32.32-34.42]:  I  think  it  was  2018.
speaker_1 [35.94-45.46]:  Okay.  How  was  it  treated  back  then?  The  clinic  gave  me  an  antibiotic  Bactrim  and  that  made  it  better.  Great.  Is
speaker_0 [45.46-50.16]:  there  any  chance  that  you're  pregnant?  I  use  protection,  but  there's  always  a  chance,  I  guess.
speaker_0 [51.16-52.90]:  So  when  was  your  last  menstrual  period?
speaker_0 [53.82-54.74]:  Three  weeks  ago.
speaker_0 [55.94-56.42]:  Okay.
speaker_1 [60.84-72.94]:  Have  you  had  any  vomiting,  nausea,  abdominal  pain,  back  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  blood  in  your  urine,  constipation,  diarrhea,  or  skin  rashes?
speaker_0 [73.70-77.00]:  Yes,  I've  had  abdominal  pain  down  low.
speaker_0 [78.00-80.74]:  And  any  vaginal  discharge  or  drainage  or  painful
speaker_1 [80.74-81.92]:  intercourse?  No.
speaker_1 [82.80-86.70]:  Okay.  Do  you  have  any  other  problems  that  you'd  like  me  to  address?  No.
speaker_0 [88.43-92.49]:  I  would  like  to  do  a  simple  physical  exam  and  have  you  give  us  a  urine  sample.
speaker_0 [93.29-97.85]:  I  will  order  both  a  pregnancy  test  and  a  urine  test  and  that  we  will  do
speaker_1 [97.85-101.81]:  now  and  determine  treatment  when  we  have  the  results.  Does  that  sound  okay  to  you?
