speaker_1 [0.52-3.84]: So you play in a band and you practice around your friend's house.
speaker_1 [4.20-4.52]: Yeah.
speaker_0 [4.58-6.14]: I mean, you must make a lot of noise.
speaker_0 [6.60-7.16]: Oh, yeah.
speaker_1 [8.78-11.78]: Well, that's the reason we go to our friend's house,
speaker_1 [11.86-13.90]: because he lives in a big detached house.
speaker_0 [14.28-15.78]: It's like a huge house, so it's OK.
speaker_1 [16.18-17.40]: OK, so you make a lot of noise.
speaker_1 [17.80-19.14]: Yeah, so that's OK, yeah.
speaker_0 [19.50-20.98]: And you've been playing together for...?
speaker_0 [21.46-23.42]: Only about a month or two months.
speaker_0 [24.36-26.64]: Well, I joined the band about a month ago,
speaker_0 [26.70-28.82]: but they've been playing for about a year, I think.
speaker_0 [28.84-29.06]: Oh, right.
speaker_1 [29.20-29.68]: Yeah, so, yeah.
speaker_0 [30.16-34.68]: and big question what's the band called oh we haven't thought of a name yet

speaker_1 [44.96-48.96]: we ever thought that sounded a bit stupid we haven't decided yet
speaker_1 [51.24-56.76]: um so you play bass in the band yeah and they you play rock you play yeah yeah
speaker_1 [58.10-61.94]: And have you got any thoughts about writing your own stuff or anything like that?
speaker_1 [62.92-67.28]: Yeah, I probably will do soon, once I've played a few more songs.
speaker_1 [67.58-71.84]: I would say the best way to make your own songs is to play other songs first,
speaker_0 [72.02-75.94]: and then get ideas, so yeah, I'll probably need to do that a bit more first.
speaker_1 [76.54-79.60]: That's good. So you've not had any public performances yet?
speaker_1 [79.94-82.76]: Not yet, no. Well, The Person's House we go to.

speaker_0 [86.33-86.57]: Right.
speaker_1 [86.79-90.53]: Or when he said, when we practice a bit more and improve,
speaker_1 [90.65-93.99]: he could get us to play a few songs at the pub.
speaker_1 [94.57-95.31]: That would be good.
speaker_1 [95.35-95.67]: Yeah.
speaker_1 [95.67-97.15]: Again, that must be a great experience,
speaker_1 [97.23-99.99]: just playing in front of a wide audience.
