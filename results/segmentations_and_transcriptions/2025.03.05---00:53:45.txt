speaker_1 [10.66-13.94]: That's called dysuria and it's pretty common. When did this start?

speaker_1 [29.81-33.03]: Do you remember about what year that was?

UNK [35.09-36.09]: Okay.
speaker_1 [36.09-39.39]: How was it treated back then?
speaker_0 [39.39-44.05]: The clinic gave me an antibiotic Bactrim and that made it better.
speaker_1 [44.05-47.59]: Great. Is there any chance that you're pregnant?

speaker_0 [73.81-77.15]: Yes, I've had abdominal pain down low.
speaker_1 [78.49-81.37]: And any vaginal discharge or drainage or painful intercourse?

speaker_1 [83.23-85.79]: Okay. Do you have any other problems that you'd like me to address?
speaker_0 [86.57-86.83]: No.
speaker_1 [88.43-101.95]: I would like to do a simple physical exam and have you give us a urine sample. I will order both a pregnancy test and a urine test, and that we will do now and determine treatment when we have the results. Does that sound okay to you?
