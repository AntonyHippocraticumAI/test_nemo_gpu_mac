00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,413
Speaker 0: Hello, Amy.

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:03,002
Speaker 0: I'm Dr.

3
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:03,325
Speaker 0: Jones.

4
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:04,046
Speaker 0: How are you doing today?

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,626
Speaker 1: I'm okay, but it hurts when I go to the bathroom when I pee.

6
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:11,932
Speaker 0: That's called dysuria, and it's pretty common.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,224
Speaker 0: When did this start?

8
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:14,820
Speaker 1: Two days ago.

9
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:17,252
Speaker 0: Have you taken anything for it?

10
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,501
Speaker 1: I tried some Tylenol and drank cranberry juice.

11
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,306
Speaker 1: It helped.

12
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:23,180
Speaker 0: Have you had this before?

13
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,379
Speaker 1: Yes, I had this several years ago before you were my doctor.

14
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:33,896
Speaker 1: Do you remember about what year that was?

15
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:38,513
Speaker 0: I think it was... Okay.

16
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:40,090
Speaker 1: How was it treated back then?

17
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:44,992
Speaker 0: The clinic gave me an antibiotic, Bactrim, and that made it better.

18
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,208
Speaker 0: Great.

19
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:48,184
Speaker 1: Is there any chance that you're pregnant?

20
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,566
Speaker 0: I use protection, but there's always a chance, I guess.

21
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,245
Speaker 0: And so when was your last menstrual period?

22
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:55,841
Speaker 0: Three weeks ago.

23
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:57,475
Speaker 0: Okay.

24
00:00:57,551 --> 00:00:59,869
Speaker 0: I think we should check her pregnancy test just to be sure.

25
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:16,969
Speaker 0: Have you had any vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood in your urine, constipation, diarrhea, or skin rashes?

26
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:22,156
Speaker 0: Yes, I've had abdominal pain down low.

27
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,911
Speaker 0: And any vaginal discharge or drainage or painful intercourse?

28
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:25,025
Speaker 0: No.

29
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:26,811
Speaker 1: Okay.

30
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:29,053
Speaker 0: Do you have any other problems that you'd like me to address?

31
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:34,259
Speaker 0: No.

32
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,351
Speaker 0: I would like to do a simple physical exam and have you give us a urine sample.

33
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:47,046
Speaker 0: I will order both a pregnancy test and a urine test and that we will do now and determine treatment when we have the results.

34
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:54,266
Speaker 0: Does that sound okay to you?
