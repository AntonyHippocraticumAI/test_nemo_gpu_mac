speaker_1 [0.00-13.98]: yeah good morning mr harris uh before we get started can i confirm your birthday uh yeah sure um so my birthday is in november 3rd 1987
speaker_0 [13.98-43.08]: great great so um how can i help you today yeah look um basically i'm just uh experiencing severe pain in my kind of like lower back and also abdomen um it's been happening for the last couple of days and uh it kind of comes and goes but when it's there it's really really bad and painful um i'm also feeling nauseous and i guess most scarily of all i i not just some
speaker_1 [43.08-49.14]: blood in my urine um yeah i'm kind of worried about that yeah i can that's definitely concerning
speaker_0 [49.14-54.26]: so um let's let's uh let me ask you a few questions have you experienced any
speaker_1 [54.42-101.40]: urinary changes such as uh you know frequency or urgency or any kind of difficulty passing urine um no not not really i mean i've noticed that my urine has the output has slightly decreased but yeah no difficulty or pain nothing okay um have you ever uh had a similar episode in the past oh no no uh this is the first time i would have remembered if i had something like this before i see um have you has there been any recent trauma or injury to your your back or abdomen or anything in your in your midsection no not really doctor i i haven't had
speaker_0 [101.40-201.68]: any no i haven't had any recent injuries um the pain kind of just appeared out of nowhere i see okay so i think we should run some tests but based on your symptoms i think you might have kidney stones i think we might be that that might be the thing we're dealing with you know especially this the back pain the the the especially the presence of blood in the urine is indicative of this typical of this condition but let let's confirm with some tests but i think that that's where i think that's what we're looking at okay uh kidney stones huh i've um yeah i mean i've heard of them um some of my family members had them never thought i would have them um but yeah um what what tests should we do so first we'll need to analyze your urine for signs of infection or stones that we can do today should be you know once we finish up the nurse will come in she'll do a quick urine you know urine pull should be uh relatively quick um the other thing that i i want to run is a uh a blood test so i'm going to run a blood test and i'm going to run a i just want to confirm that there's nothing going wrong with your kidney function uh just to make sure everything's kind of you know your blood is still being filtered and cleaned your kidneys are still performing basically um the the thing we'll do again that the blood test the nurse will come in later she can she can pull that uh before you leave today so after we run those tests it should be about a day maybe two days to before we get an answer uh but you know we'll get an answer
speaker_0 [204.42-422.66]: um so next we're going to do a follow-up for a renal ultrasound what this will do is this this is typically uh you know they'll visualize your your kidneys and if there are any large stones we'll get a clear picture on how many how big they are that sort of thing uh so nothing you know just some initial tests nothing invasive okay okay yeah um i mean i'm i'm happy that we'll be able to figure out what's going on with your kidneys uh so i'm going to schedule you a follow-up really want to get rid of this pain um what should i expect in terms of treatment if we confirm that these are kidney stones so kidney stones are very treatable very typical problem it happens in a large segment of the population so it's nothing to be afraid of uh in terms of treatment a lot of times it's as simple as you know increasing your hydration you know being very dedicated in uh increasing your hydration like you i want to get rid of this pain um what should i expect in terms of treatment if we confirm that you want you know ideally you'll be drinking like at least almost half a gallon of water a day maybe more and we can we can kind of i'll do you know we'll have a bit of a look on exactly how much you should be taking but really over hydrating um uh some pain management so we'll you know if we confirm the diagnosis typically you know we'll give you a prescription for some pain management uh uh drugs and then uh ideally you just pass the stones naturally as part of that process um they'll oh sorry there's also some medications around just making it easier to pass the stones in your urine so some medications that'll help break down the stones in your kidneys and just you know hopefully they're small and they just pass through um so a lot of the times it's just medication in some cases i would say uh you know a good chunk of cases uh if the stones are a little too large or if they're causing some complications we one of the things we'll do is uh we'll probably do is a shockwave lithotripsy okay that's where you're suspended in a in a in a water effectively a liquid bath and essentially ultrasonic waves are shot at your at the stones in your kidneys with the goal of essentially breaking them up and making them smaller so that you can pass them uh normally in very rare circumstances we may also have to schedule a surgery but i i don't i don't that's not a typical uh case but you know we'll have to see based on the results of the test but i wouldn't worry too much about it it's pretty standard there's not that you know that's uh it's a very well understood uh both a well understood disease and also a well understood process so it's nothing life-threatening nothing to worry about okay thank you thanks for clarifying that yeah let's definitely hope it's not going to be any surgical but yeah i really really appreciate the explanation um i think let's let's move forward with this then okay so i'll uh i'll uh call in the nurse she'll finish up the you know finish up a little bit of my write-up call the nurse she'll take your tests we should know we should have pretty good confirmation within 24 hours 24 to 48 hours once the lab results come back um and then we can schedule you for the follow-up stuff there and if you go to the front desk they'll schedule you for the ultrasound okay okay great thank you so much doctor and uh yeah have a good day thank you have a good day bye
