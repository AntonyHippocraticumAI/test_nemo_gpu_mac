TRANSCRIPTIONS:
	Hello, Amy. I'm Dr. Jones. How are you doing today?
I'm okay, but it hurts when I go to the
bathroom when I pee. That's called dysuria, and it's pretty
common. When did this start? Two days ago. Have you
taken anything for it? I tried some Tylenol and drank
cranberry juice. It helped. Have you had this before? Yes,
I had this several years ago before you were my
doctor. Do you remember about what year that was? I
think it was 2018. Okay. How was it treated back
then? The clinic gave me an antibiotic Bactrom and that
made it better. Great. Is there any chance that you're
pregnant? I use protection, but there's always a chance, I
guess. And so when was your last menstrual period? Three
weeks ago. Okay. I think we should check a pregnancy
test just to be sure. Have you had any vomiting,
nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood in
your urine, constipation, diarrhea, or skin rashes? Yes, I've had
abdominal pain down low. And any vaginal discharge or drainage
or painful intercourse? No. Okay. Do you have any other
problems that you'd like me to address? No. Okay. I
would like to do a simple physical exam and have
you give us a urine sample. I will order both
a pregnancy test and a urine test and that we
will do now and determine treatment when we have the
results. Does that sound okay to you?
