TRANSCRIPTIONS:
	Hello, Amy. I'm Dr. Jones. How are you doing today?
I'm okay, but it hurts when I go to the
bathroom when I pee. That's called dysuria and it's pretty
common. When did this start? Two days ago. Have you
taken anything for it? I tried some Tylenol and drank
cranberry juice. It helped. Have you had this before? Yes,
I had this several years ago before you were my
doctor. Do you remember about what year that was? I
think it was 2018. Okay. How was it treated back
then? The clinic gave me an antibiotic, Bactrim, and that
made it better. Great. Is there any chance that you're
pregnant? I use protection, but there's always a chance, I
guess. When was your last menstrual period? Three weeks ago.
Okay. I think we should check a pregnancy test just
to be sure. Okay. Have you had any vomits? No.
Vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood
in your urine, constipation, diarrhea, or skin rashes? Yes, I've
had abdominal pain down low. And any vaginal discharge or
drainage or painful intercourse? No. Okay. Do you have any
other problems that you'd like me to address? No. Okay.
I would like to do a simple physical exam and
have you give us a urine sample. I will order
both a pregnancy test and a urine test and that
we will do now and determine treatment when we have
the results. Does that sound okay to you? Okay. Thanks.
