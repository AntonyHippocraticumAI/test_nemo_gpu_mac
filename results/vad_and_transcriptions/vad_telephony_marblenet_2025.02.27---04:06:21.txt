okay. But it hurts when I go to the bathroom
when I pee. That's called . It's pretty common. When
did this start? Two days ago. Have you taken anything
for it? No. I went out and drank cranberry juice
and help. Have you had this before? Yes. I had
this several years ago before you were my doctor. Do
you remember about what year that was? I think it
was 2018. Okay. How was it treated back then? The
clinic gave me an antibiotic and that made it better.

your last menstrual period? Three weeks ago. Okay. I think
we should check her pregnancy, sure. Okay. Have you had
any vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath,
blood in your urine, constipation, diarrhea, rashes? Yes, I've had
abdominal pain down low. Any vaginal drainage or painful intercourse?
No. Okay. Do you have any other problems that you'd
like me to address? No. Okay. I would like to
do a simple question. I'm going to do a physical
exam and have you take a urine sample. I will
order both pregnancy tests and a urine test and that
we will do now and determine treatment when we ...
Does that sound okay to you? Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
Bye. Bye. Bye.
