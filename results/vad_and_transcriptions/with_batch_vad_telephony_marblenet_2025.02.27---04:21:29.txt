No, and drink cranberry juice and help. Have you had
this before? Yes, I had this several years ago before
you were my doctor. Do you remember about what year
that was? um i think it was 2018. okay how
was it treated back then the clinic gave me an
antibiotic um and that made it better is there any
chance that you're pregnant i use protection but there's always
a chance i guess and so when was your last
menstrual period uh three weeks ago okay i think we

nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood in
your urine, constipation, diarrhea, rashes? Yes, I've had abdominal pain
down low. And any vaginal drainage or painful intercourse? No.
Okay. Do you have any other problems that you'd like
me to address? No. Okay. I would like to do
a simple physical exam and have you take a urine
sample. I will order both a pregnancy test and a
urine test and that we will do now and determine
treatment when we... Does that sound okay to you?
